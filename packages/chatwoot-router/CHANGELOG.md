# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Independent Chatwoot routing Worker extracted from chatwoot-discord-relay: TypeSafe Jev decisions, owner/topic/kind
  classification, request detection, redaction, reply-once canned responses, and durable retries.
- Signed per-account webhooks and a five-minute reconciliation sweep, with per-account conversation display-id
  cutover watermarks (`startAfterConversationId`, an account-id map; omitted accounts default to `0`).
- Conversation custom attributes coordinate routing completion and handled messages with chatwoot-discord-relay.
- Standalone npm package, Worker exports, and `chatwoot-router-store-config` for immutable KV configuration.
